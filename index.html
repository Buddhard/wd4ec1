    <header>This is a small selection of all the cats I lived with in my life. I hope you like cats as much as I do. :-)
        I
        lived with a lot more cats than this, and codgs and birds. For this course I'd like to share some information
        about the cats.

                    <p>Benito was the first Maine Coone cat I met. Thats when I fell in love with these big hairy cats
                        with relaxed minds. Benito was very talkative and cuddly.</p>

                    <p>Johann was a common black cat. He was born on a farm yard and a cow layed down on him. Our
                        former vet wanted to put him into sleep, but her son said "mom, he just needs some love". And so
                        he
                        lived with a little mental weakness happily everafter, running into walls and fighting invisible
                        flies. </p>

                    <p>Misha (Barton) is the cat of my wives family. To this day Misha is 18 years old and refuses to
                        visit the vet. She'd rather die a heartattack than entering a transport box or a car. If she'd
                        arrive at the vet alive, she'd kill everyone there. Apart from that she is a common black cat
                        like
                        Johann. She can be cuddly if she chooses to. When it comes to meals, she has Alzheimers and can
                        eat
                        several meals within a few minutes.

                        Ling Ling is - after Hector - the second cat that moved in into one of my first appartements. We
                        didnt want Hector to be alone :-) Ling Ling is a cozy cuddly talkative calm minded Maine Coone
                        Persion mixed breed. She loved to sleep in bed with my former girlfried and me and helped me at
                        work
                        in homeoffice, snoring on my lap. Hector and Ling Ling didnt like eachother much, it was more
                        like
                        accepting eachother.

                    <p>
                        Hector was the first cat that moved in with my former girlfried and me. Hector was a redblonde
                        Persian Maine Coone mixed breed. Even more talkative and cuddly than Ling Ling and very clumsy.
                        He
                        once fell out of the window and wasnt very good at acrobatic balancing. He was very good at
                        melting
                        peoples hearts. Everyone loved Hector, even the people who pretended to not like cats.
